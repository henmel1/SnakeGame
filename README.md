This project includes the classic snake game, coded in Python. The player can turn the snake, eat "fruits" (pink squares), and try to get the highest score without running into the borders of the screen or other sections of the snake itself. Snake length increases by 1 with each fruit eaten.

Controls: WASD to change direction of snake. The player cannot make a 180 degree turn, they must make two 90 degree turns. 
For example, if going up, player cannot press S and go down. Instead, press D and S or A and S in succession to turn around.

To use: download and run main.py
